So we have no labels for the data points, and the goal is to get an insigt into the data distribution, and see if we can make some sense of it. __Two important problems__ are __clustering__, where we applying algorithms to try and find natural clusters within the data, and __outlier detection__, where we try to indentity data points which seem to deviate from the pattern in the data."
